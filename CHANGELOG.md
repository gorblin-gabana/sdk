- **Replay Attacks**: Unique nonces prevent message replay
- **Tampering**: Metadata tampering is detected and rejected
- **Forward Secrecy**: Past messages remain secure after key rotation
- **Side Channels**: Timing attacks are mitigated with constant-time operations

#### Compliance Features
- **Audit Trails**: All operations include timestamps and actor identification
- **Key Rotation**: Emergency key rotation capabilities
- **Access Revocation**: Immediate removal of user access
